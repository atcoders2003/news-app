# News App v0.1.0 — Implementation Plan

**Plan ID**: newsapp-v0.1.0
**Target Release**: v0.1.0
**Status**: Draft
**Roadmap Epic Alignment**: Release v0.1.0 - Swipe-First News Feed ([agent-output/roadmap/product-roadmap.md](agent-output/roadmap/product-roadmap.md))

## Value Statement and Business Objective
As a casual mobile reader, I want a swipeable, topic-and-location-prioritized news feed so that I can quickly discover relevant stories and dive into full articles with minimal friction.

## Summary
This plan breaks the MVP into implementable milestones: scaffold app, implement swipeable card feed with gesture handlers, add preferences & location selector, integrate NewsAPI backend with caching and rate-limit handling, and provide a readable full-article view with sharing. The plan focuses on delivering measurable engagement improvements and rapid user validation.

## Assumptions
- NewsAPI key is available and provides article metadata and origin URLs. We'll proceed on the free tier and make a single request per selected topic to stay within free quotas.
- The product will be a single-page web app (mobile-first) using **React + Vite**.
- No auth required for MVP; preferences persist locally.

**DECISION**: Framework locked to React+Vite; gesture library choice deferred to implementer.

## Required Analysis (REQUIRES ANALYSIS)
- Preferred location granularity (city vs. region vs. country) and fallback behavior — RECOMMENDED.

## Milestones & Tasks

1) Project scaffold and CI (Est: 0.5 day)
   - Create project skeleton in `news-app/` (frontend app, package.json, README)
   - Add basic lint/prettier config and a minimal dev server script
   - Acceptance: App runs locally and serves a placeholder card feed

2) NewsAPI integration (Est: 1 day)
   - Implement fetch layer to request headlines and article metadata. For each user-selected topic issue a single request (per session/load) to NewsAPI and aggregate results into the feed.
   - Implement error mapping for quota, network, and malformed responses; emit clear UI fallbacks when free-tier limits are reached.
   - Acceptance: App displays live headlines in the feed when API key provided and uses one request per selected topic to limit quota usage.
   - **NOTE**: For public deployments, prefer a serverless proxy to keep the key secret; local dev may use a placeholder `.env` key.

3) Preferences & Location Selector (Est: 1 day)
   - Implement onboarding/settings UI to pick topics and location (manual input + geolocation fallback)
   - Persist preferences to local storage and expose a simple preferences API to feed logic
   - Acceptance: Preferences persist and drive the first fetch results

4) Swipeable Card Feed (Est: 2 days)
   - Implement card UI with swipe left/right to advance and double-tap to open
   - Smooth transitions and accessible fallbacks (keyboard, tap buttons)
   - Acceptance: Gestures work reliably on mobile and desktop; metrics tracking events emitted

5) Full-Article View & Sharing (Est: 0.5 day)
   - Reader view that opens article link or renders a readable summary
   - Native share sheet integration or copy-to-clipboard when share unavailable
   - Acceptance: Double-tap opens article view; share action functions

6) Caching, Offline & Rate-Limit Handling (Est: 1 day)
   - Cache headlines and recently viewed articles in IndexedDB (or localStorage for small MVP)
   - Implement retry/backoff and clear user-facing messaging when API limits reached. Given free-tier constraints, favor caching and single-request-per-topic to reduce calls.
   - Acceptance: Cached headlines available offline for 24 hours; UI shows fallback when rate-limited

7) Instrumentation & Metrics (Est: 0.5 day)
   - Add simple event tracking for swipes, double-tap opens, preference changes, and API errors
   - Acceptance: Events captured locally and visible in dev console; export hooks for analytics later

8) QA, polish, and release artifacts (Est: 0.5 day)
   - Fix accessibility issues, layout on common devices, update README and CHANGELOG
   - Update version to `v0.1.0` and add release notes

## Dependencies
- Decide framework (React recommended) and gesture approach
- NewsAPI key and quota details
- CI provider selection for deploy (Vercel recommended)

## Risks and Mitigations
- NewsAPI rate limits: mitigate with caching, exponential backoff, and server-side proxy if necessary
- Exposing API key: avoid embedding key in public builds; use a simple serverless proxy or environment variable during deploy
- Gesture reliability across browsers: implement accessible fallback controls and test on common devices

## Acceptance Criteria (Epic-level)
- Users can select topics and location; the first 10 cards prioritize those preferences (≥70% relevance as defined by roadmap)
- Swipe and double-tap interactions are responsive and intuitive on mobile
- Cached content available offline for at least 24 hours

## Handoffs
- Architect: Request ADR for API key protection, caching approach, and any serverless proxy architecture
- Critic: Review the plan for completeness and scope rounding
- Implementer: Execute milestones and update `agent-output/planning/` with progress notes

## Version Management
- Final milestone: Update `package.json` version to `0.1.0`, add CHANGELOG entry referencing this plan, and tag release branch `release/v0.1.0`

## Next Steps for the User
- Confirm framework preference and whether to host the API key in a proxy or accept a placeholder key for local dev.
- Approve plan to proceed with scaffolding and implementation.
